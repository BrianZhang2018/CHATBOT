Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with environment

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: The data used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for prediction
- Labels: Output variables to predict
- Model: The learned function that maps inputs to outputs
- Overfitting: When model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: When model is too simple to capture patterns in data

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
